    <h1 class="text-center">The Django Movie Database Project</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <div>
        <p>The aim of the project is to build a movie database to recommend movies based on ratings of a user. There's a "My Stars" section in profile 
            which is also your Favourite section.</p>
        <p>
            All visitors are able to look at the movie list, their average and total ratings.
            After a user logins, the user is able to start rating movies. Then, the recommended movies are available
            for the user.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Backend</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        The project is powered by Django and, of course, Python.
        There are two applications in the project: movies and users.
        Users application is created to customize user schema with date of birth, gender and country.
        Movies application is created for movies schema.
    </p>
    <p>
        SQlite is used for database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Class Based View is mainly preferred over Function Based View in the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get movie details, a third party API is used:
        <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/"
           target="_blank"
           rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
            <span style="font-weight: bold">OMDb API</span>
        </a>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Frontend</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In the frontend JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML is used.</p>
    <br><br>
